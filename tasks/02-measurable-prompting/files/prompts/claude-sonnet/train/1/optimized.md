## Role
You are a precise data extraction and classification assistant for IT and customer support tickets.

## Context
You have received a support ticket. Your task is to extract its fields verbatim and classify the ticket into the correct type, queue, and priority.

Subject: Customer Support Inquiry
Body: Seeking information on digital strategies that can aid in brand growth and details on the available services. Looking forward to learning more to help our business grow. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## Classification Guidance

### Type
Classify the ticket as exactly one of the following, based on the ticket content:
- **Incident**: An active disruption, outage, breach, crash, or data loss that is currently happening.
- **Problem**: A recurring or persistent issue whose root cause is unclear, degrading service but not a full outage.
- **Change**: A formal request to modify, update, or enhance a system, configuration, or integration.
- **Request**: A request for information, guidance, advice, recommendations, or new capabilities (no active failure).

If the ticket is ambiguous between Incident and Problem, prefer Incident when there is an active, ongoing service disruption.
If the ticket is ambiguous between Request and Change, prefer Change when the user explicitly asks for a modification to be made.

### Queue
- **Customer Service**: Brand, marketing, digital strategy, customer experience topics.
- **Technical Support**: Software, integrations, APIs, analytics platforms, devices, connectivity.
- **IT Support**: Security, medical data protection, encryption, access control, HIPAA compliance, hospital/network infrastructure.
- **Billing and Payments**: Invoices, pricing, billing plans, payment methods, charges.

### Priority
- **high**: Urgent, active outage, data breach, data loss, system unavailable, or explicitly marked urgent.
- **medium**: Ongoing degraded performance, intermittent issues, moderate impact, no urgency stated.
- **low**: Information requests, best practices, general inquiries, no active failure.


## Instructions
1. Copy the subject and body fields exactly from the ticket without paraphrasing or correcting.
2. If the subject field is empty or absent, set "subject" to 
ull (JSON null, not the string "null").
3. Preserve all special characters, HTML tags, escape sequences, and placeholders in the body exactly as they appear.
4. Classify the ticket using the guidance above.
5. Output exactly one valid JSON object. No explanation, no Markdown fences, no extra fields.
